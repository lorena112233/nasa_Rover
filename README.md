## About: 
### Problem - Mars Rover
A squad of robotic rovers are to be landed by NASA on a plateau on Mars.This plateau, which is curiously rectangular, must be navigated by therovers so that their on-board cameras can get a complete view of thesurrounding terrain to send back to Earth.

A rover's position and location are represented by a combination of x and yco-ordinates and a letter representing one ofthe four cardinal compasspoints. The plateau is divided up into a grid to simplify navigation. Anexample position mightbe 0, 0, N, which means the rover is in the bottomleft corner and facing North.

In order to control a rover, NASA sends a simple string of letters. Thepossible letters are 'L', 'R' and 'M'. 'L' and 'R' makesthe rover spin 90degrees left or right respectively, without moving from its current spot.'M' means move forward one grid point and maintain the same heading.

Assume that the square directly North from (x, y) is (x, y+1).

Write a simple application that takes a userâ€™s starting point, and then directional instructions and displays the resulting position to the user.
